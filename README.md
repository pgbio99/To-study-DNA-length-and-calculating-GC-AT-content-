# To study DNA length and calculating GC-AT content
Here are two scripts, one for calculating GC and purine content. The IGF1 DNA sequence is chosen from NCBI (Gene), and its FASTA file is downloaded; then first the length of the whole DNA sequence, GC & purine is calculated. After it, the GC and purine content present in the IGF1 DNA sequence is calculated.

The second file has a slightly different Python script used to calculate AT and pyrimidine content. A DNA sequence is chosen from the Y chromosome (mouse), then its FASTA file is downloaded, and the same steps are followed as for the former one.
